# Description
Implement a minimal backtest on one specific cryptocurrency using historical price data and a simple technical indicator (e.g., RSI or moving averages). Then summarize the strategyâ€™s performance metrics over the selected historical period and note key lessons for actual trading.

# Notes
Use RSI (weekly). Strategy should be something like sell if RSI > 75 and buy if < 25. Pretty simple to implement I think
